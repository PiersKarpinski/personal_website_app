								<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
								<p>I'm a qualified lawyer, junior web developer and budding entrpreneur. I'm based in London and enjoying the Indian summer of my mid-20s.</p>
								<p>I have always been a fan of words.  I enjoy reading them for pleasure and analysing them for meaning.  Two of my favourite books are <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> and <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> by Lewis Carroll.  My fascination with words is one of the reasons I became a lawyer and probably one of the reasons I find back-end web development difficult!</p>

											<h3><i class="icon-user icon-white"></i> More About Me?</h3>
											I like trying things. I believe that you only get one life so you should do what you love and not settle for anything less. I think people worry too much and I endorse what the Dalai Lama said to Brad Pitt in Seven Years in Tibet: "If a problem can be solved there is no use worrying about it. If it can't be solved, worrying will do no good".
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-bookmark icon-white"></i> What I've Done</h3>
											I was lucky enough to go to Oxford University where I studied History. I've tried my hand as an English language teacher, first in Kenya and then in Venezuela. I dabble in web development and I've spent a number of years training to be and being a lawyer (if law's your thing, see the Lawyer section for more details).
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-plane icon-white"></i> Where I'm going</h3>
											This is the part that I'm really excited about. Areobooks was founded in the spring of 2014 and is an e book start-up that publishes and distributes e books for self-published authors and publishers. The Areobooks website will launch in early 2015. See the Entrepreneur section for more details.

											You can get hold of me via email at piers.karpinski@gmail.com, or via LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter. You're also quite likely to find me strolling through the parks in London. See the Contact Me section for more details (on how to contact me. For more on London parks I recommend <a href="http://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/londons-major-parks">This article).</a>

								<h2>I'm a lawyer</h2>
								<p>To be precise, I'm a solicitor qualified to practise law in England & Wales.</p>
								<p>Until recently I worked as a dispute resolution associate at a firm of solicitors called Hogan Lovells, based in their London office. I left Hogan Lovells at the end of May 2014 to focus on Areobooks (the start-up I founded). I am passionate about law and open to opportunities for part-time or contract work while Areobooks takes flight. I specialise in commercial litigation and have a lot of experience working on large discovery projects.</p>

										<div class="row about-us">
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-pencil icon-white"></i> Where I studied</h3>
											I didn't study Law at University so as well as studying for the LPC (which all law graduates have to complete in order to practise) I did a law conversion course known as the GDL. I studied for both the GDL and the LPC with BPP in London from 2009-2011. 
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-book icon-white"></i> Where I trained</h3>
											I was offered a training contract by Hogan Lovells, which began in August 2011 and finished in August 2013. During my training contract I sat in the following departments: Banking; Tax; Business Restructuring & Insolvency; and Contentious Insolvency.
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-briefcase icon-white"></i> Where I practised</h3>
											I stayed at Hogan Lovells when I qualified in August 2013, qualifying into the Contentious Insolvency department. I spent the following 10 months working on an insolvency and pensions dispute concerning the collapse of a large multinational company. I left Hogan Lovells at the end of May 2014.
											</div>   
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-globe icon-white"></i> Why I left</h3>
											Law is great, and I look back at my time with Hogan Lovells with a lot of pride. However, I had a nagging doubt that I was meant for something different. While I'm a good lawyer, I'm a better entrepreneur and Areobooks is where I can express myself fully.

								<h2>I'm an entrepreneur</h2>
								<p>I see things and think of ways they could be done differently, more efficiently, better.</p>
								<p>Areobooks was founded in the spring of 2014. Our vision is simple: put authors and publishers in control of how their e books are published and distributed; remunerate them according to the actual cost of publishing and distributing e books. Afterall, the cost of selling 1 copy of an e book is roughly the same as the cost of selling 1 million copies of that e book.</p>

											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-star icon-white"></i> The name</h3>
											Areobooks shares the first four letters of its name with Areopagitica, a tract written by John Milton (you know, the guy who wrote Paradise Lost) opposing licensing and censorship of the press. Areobooks shares Milton's belief that the greatest benefits come from people having access to the greatest number of ideas.
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-book icon-white"></i> Our mission</h3>
											Authors and publishers should be at the centre of e books and that means handing them the reigns. Authors and publishers who choose to sell e books through Areobooks have complete control over how their e books are priced and marketed, and how they choose to connect with their audience.
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-calendar icon-white"></i> Why now?</h3>
											E books represent 15% of the UK publishing market. As the technology behind e books improves that number will rise. However, the e book marketplace is dominated by print book thinking. Areobooks is needed to shake-up that marketplace. Doing so will create a fairer and more efficient environment for all participants. 
											</div>   
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-bullhorn icon-white"></i> Find out more</h3>
											Arebooks will launch in earnest in 2015. However, we will be launching a landing page for Areobooks shortly, which will (among other things) contain details on how to sign up to the Areobooks newsletter. In the meantime, please contact me if you have any questions (see the Contact Me section for details).
