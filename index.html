								<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
								<p>I am a qualified lawyer, junior web developer and budding entrpreneur. I'm based in London and enjoying the Indian summer of my mid-20s.</p>
								<p>I have always been a fan of words.  I enjoy reading them for pleasure and analysing them for meaning.  Two of my favourite books are <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> and <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> by Lewis Carroll.  My fascination with words is one of the reasons I became a lawyer and probably one of the reasons I find back-end web development difficult!</p>

											<h3><i class="icon-user icon-white"></i> More About Me?</h3>
											I like trying things. I believe that you only get one life so you should do what you love and not settle for anything less. I think people worry too much and I endorse what the Dalai Lama said to Brad Pitt in Seven Years in Tibet: "If a problem can be solved there is no use worrying about it. If it can't be solved, worrying will do no good".
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-bookmark icon-white"></i> What I've Done</h3>
											I was lucky enough to go to Oxford University where I studied History. I've tried my hand as an English language teacher, first in Kenya and then in Venezuela. I dabble in web development and I've spent a number of years training to be and being a lawyer (if law's your thing, see the Lawyer section for more details).
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-plane icon-white"></i> Where I'm going</h3>
											This is the part that I'm really excited about. Areobooks was founded in the spring of 2014 and is an e book start-up that publishes and distributes e books for both self-published authors and traditional publishers. The Areobooks website will launch in early 2015. See the Entrepreneur section for more details.

											You can get hold of me via email at piers.karpinski@gmail.com, or via LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter. You're also quite likely to find me strolling through the parks in London.

								<h2>I'm a lawyer</h2>
								<p>To be precise, I'm a solicitor qualified to practise law in England & Wales.</p>
								<p>Up until May 2014 I worked as a dispute resolution associate at a firm of solicitors called Hogan Lovells, based in their London office. I left Hogan Lovells at the end of May 2014 to focus on my start-up, Areobooks. However, I love being a lawyer and am on the look-out for part-time or contract work. I specialise in commercial litigation and have a lot of experience working on large discovery projects.</p>

											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-pencil icon-white"></i> Where I studied</h3>
											I didn't read Law at University (I read History at Oxford, graduating in 2008). Therefore, as well as studying for the LPC (which all law graduates have to complete in order to practise) I did a law conversion course (known as the GDL). I studied for both the GDL and the LPC with BPP in London from 2009-2011. 
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-book icon-white"></i> Where I trained</h3>
											I was offered a training contract by Hogan Lovells, which began in August 2011 and finished in August 2013. During my training contract I sat in the following departments: Banking; Tax; Business Restructuring & Insolvency; and Contentious Insolvency.
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-briefcase icon-white"></i> Where I practised</h3>
											I stayed at Hogan Lovells when I qualified in August 2013, qualifying into the Contentious Insolvency department. I spent the following 10 months working on an insolvency and pensions dispute concerning the collapse of a large multinational company. I left Hogan Lovells at the end of May 2014.
											</div>   
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-globe icon-white"></i> Why I left</h3>
											Law is great, and I look back at my time with Hogan Lovells with a lot of pride. However, I had a nagging doubt that I was meant for something different. That something different is the idea for a start-up that I've had for the past couple of years and which has become Areobooks.

								<h2>I'm an entrepreneur</h2>
								<p>I often see things and can't help but think of ways they could be done differently, more efficiently, better. I like to be part of that process of improvement.</p>
								<p>Areobooks was founded in the spring of 2014 for these reasons. Our vision is to replace the outdated models on which the creators of books are rewarded, creating a more efficient model that appropriately reflects the realities of e book publishing and distribution, and which represents a clean break from the old world of print books.</p>

											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-star icon-white"></i> What's in a name?</h3>
											Areobooks shares the first four letters of its name with Areopagitica, a tract written by John Milton (you know, the guy who wrote Paradise Lost) opposing licensing and censorship of the press. Milton's vision is no different to that of Areobooks: that the greatest benefits come from people having access to the greatest number of ideas.
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-book icon-white"></i> What is Areobooks?</h3>
											Areobooks is an e book publishing and distribution website that puts authors and publishers in control of the content they have created. Control in terms of price, marketing and how they connect with and add to their audience. Areobooks does all this without taking any cut of the sale price of any e book sold.
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-calendar icon-white"></i> Why now?</h3>
											E books currently represent 15% of the UK publishing market. E book market share continues to grow, though some are suggesting that it is beginning to plateau. Areobooks will help invigorate the pace of change and allow authors and publishers to take advantage of the benefits that technology is bestowing upon them.
											</div>   
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-bullhorn icon-white"></i> Want to learn more?</h3>
											We will be launcing a landing page for Areobooks shortly, which will contain details on how to sign up to the Areobooks newsletter and hear more from us generally. In the meantime, please do contact me with any questions you might have (see the Contact Me section for more details).
