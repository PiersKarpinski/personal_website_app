								<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
								<p>I am a qualified lawyer, junior web developer and budding entrpreneur. I'm based in London and currently enjoying the Indian summer of my mid-20s.</p>
								<p>I have always been a fan of words.  I enjoy reading them for pleasure and analysing them for meaning.  Two of my favourite books are <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> and <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> by Lewis Carroll.  My fascination with words is one of the reasons I became a lawyer and probably one of the reasons I find back-end web development difficult!</p>

											<h3><i class="icon-user icon-white"></i> More About Me?</h3>
											I like trying things. I believe that you only get one life so you should do what you love and that you shouldn't settle for anything less. I think people worry too much; one of my favourite quotes is from Seven Years in Tibet, when the Dalai Lama tells Brad Pitt that "If a problem can be solved there is no use worrying about it. If it can't be solved, worrying will do no good".
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-bookmark icon-white"></i> What I've Done</h3>
											I was lucky enough to go to Oxford University where I studied History. I've tried my hand as an English language teacher, first in Kenya and then in Venezuela. I dabble in web development and I have spent a number of years training to be and being a lawyer (if law's your thing, see the Lawyer section for more details).

											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-plane icon-white"></i> Where I'm going</h3>
											This is the part I'm excited about. 
											</div>   
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-envelope icon-white"></i> Get in touch</h3>
											You can get hold of me via email (piers.karpinski@gmail.com), LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter. You're also quite likely to find me wandering around the parks in London (though not lonely as a cloud). See the Contact Me section for more details.
